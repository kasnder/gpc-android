# gpc-ios

The basic idea for sending GPC signals on iOS devices is to provide developers with a library that surfaces to the users of their apps a GPC setting. 
Initially, there even does not need to be a UI; just sending the signal, e.g., at certain time intervals when the app is in use is sufficient.
