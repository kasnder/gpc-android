With Apple's recent introduction of the [App Tracking Transparency Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency), de facto, we already have GPC on iOS. It just goes by a different name. Especially, [Apple's definition of Tracking](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/#user-tracking) neatly matches GPC:

> “Tracking” refers to linking data collected from your app about a particular end-user or device, such as a user ID, device ID, or profile, with Third-Party Data for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes, or sharing data collected from your app about a particular end-user or device with a data broker.

Thus, bringing GPC to Android may be a more worthwhile endeavor at this point. [Especially](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/google-explores-alternative-to-apple-s-new-anti-tracking-feature?sref=ExbtjcSG),

> Google is exploring an alternative to Apple Inc.’s new anti-tracking feature, the latest sign that the internet industry is slowly embracing user privacy, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
